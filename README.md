# config-server
> Configuration service: Configuration center for unified management of service configuration files. The local service directly applies the configuration of the configuration file without starting the service. The configurations of all services except manager-service, register-server, and config-server are pulled from config-sever, and config-server obtains configuration from the manager-service management service. The configuration of the service needs to import the service configuration into the manager-service database through choerodon-tool-config.

- Pull configuration rules.
  
If the service includes the configuration version when pulling configurations, the corresponding version configuration is pulled; otherwise, the default configuration is pulled.

Choerodon's configuration serviceï¼Œis also the configuration center for unified management of service configuration files.

## Requirements
- This project based on eureka client. The local executing needs to cooperate with register-server, and the online executing needs to cooperate with go-register-server.
- The config-server obtains the configuration from the manager-service management service and needs to start the manager-service.
- The configuration of other services needs to be imported into the manager-service database by using choerodon-tool-config.

## To get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/choerodon/config-server.git
```

## Installation and Getting Started
- run register-server
- switch into the project directory and run mvn spring-boot:run or run ConfigServerApplication in idea

## Usage
- Generate a mirror manually

   Pull source code, execute mvn clean install, generate app.jar in target directory, then copy to src/main/docker, which have dockerfile, then execute docker build to generate image.
- Use existing mirror


- After creating the image, create a new deployment on k8s and create a service. You can refer to the code directory deployment file written in the code.

## Dependencies
- go-register-server: Registration service
- manager-service: Management service
- kafka

## Note
- Local service uses the configuration in the configuration file directly, without starting the service
- It need to work with manager-service when execute online, and 
- Online needs to be used in conjunction with manager-service, And the configuration of the service needs to import service configuration into manager-service database by choerodon-tool-config
